- reviewed discussion from 2019-07-09
    - structure of the software
    - how to progress from that
    - more datasets
    - Spectral Clustering as one analysis pipeline
        - define such pipelines as class
        - or define as chain of commands from base class implementations
            - Distance, Affinity, Embedding, Clustering
        - work out example case for exactly that

        
- Work packages
    - Tracked and assigned via gitlab issues
    - Priorities!
    - Well-defined tasks
        - next to that:
            - Scan data for interesting stuff and write down findings 
            - working on documentation would always be a useful thing to do :)

    - Vispr:
        - customizable interface (to support free and adequate analysis)
            - variable number of images shown (heatmap/image grid size)
            - selection of visualized elements
            - multiple parallel results visualized for cross-analysis ...
        - tagging feature: mark clusters save to some database (high priority)
    
    - Sprincl:
        - Different (pre)processing functions: size-normalization, informatino extraction (Bag of Features):
            - Pass data-to-be-analyzed 
        - Different distance functions: l2, optimal transport, frequency domain(?)
        - Different affinity functions
        - Different Embedding functions
        - Different Clustering tools
        - Different Visualizations (TSNE, force-directed graph layout ... )
        - Additional predefined pipelines frome those tools (inheriting from Pipeline base class)
            - Add optional checkpoint system for saving data after a or each pipeline step, to be loaded lateron (avoid redundant computation, save time when changing details in later pipeline steps)
        
    - Other:
        - Data Preparation
    

- Future:
    - Base Vispr code on Sprincl for (dynamic/static)
