## Backend

- Preprocessing: Bag-of-pixels: various approaches
- Distance methods in `sprincl/distance.py`
  - structural similarity
  - bag-of-stuff
  - optimal transport
- clustering methods in `sprincl/clustering.py`
  - DBSCAN
  - Agglomerative Clustering
  - KMeans class for structural completeness
- analysis frameworks are pre-defined pipelines, like the class `SpectralEmbedding`

## Frontend

- Pipeline-dependent frontend
  - (class SpectralClustering is an example for a pipeline)

## Result management

- interesting results should be documented in `docs/interesting_results.md`
  - at some point, these results will be stored in a database, which can be updated using the visualizer front-end
- PASCAL-VOC and Adience Results from Nature paper are to be integrated in the current database

## Git management

- `master` is the development branch
- new features/ fixes are to be reported by creating an issue and implementing on a dedicated branch
- stable version can be marked using git tags
