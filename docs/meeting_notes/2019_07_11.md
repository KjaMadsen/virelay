- reviewed discussion from 2019-07-09
  - structure of the software
  - how to progress from that
  - more datasets
  - Spectral Clustering as one analysis pipeline
    - define such pipelines as class
    - or define as chain of commands from base class implementations
      - Distance, Affinity, Embedding, Clustering
  - work out example case for exactly that

- Work packages
  - Tracked and assigned via GitLab issues
  - Priorities!
  - Well-defined tasks
    - next to that:
      - Scan data for interesting stuff and write down findings
      - working on documentation would always be a useful thing to do :)

  - VISPR:
    - customizable interface (to support free and adequate analysis)
      - variable number of images shown (heatmap/image grid size)
      - selection of visualized elements
      - multiple parallel results visualized for cross-analysis ...
    - tagging feature: mark clusters save to some database (high priority)

  - SPRINCL:
    - Different (pre)processing functions: size-normalization, information extraction (Bag of Features):
      - Pass data-to-be-analyzed
    - Different distance functions: l2, optimal transport, frequency domain(?)
    - Different affinity functions
    - Different Embedding functions
    - Different Clustering tools
    - Different Visualizations (TSNE, force-directed graph layout ... )
    - Additional predefined pipelines from those tools (inheriting from Pipeline base class)
      - Add optional checkpoint system for saving data after a or each pipeline step, to be loaded later on (avoid redundant computation, save time when changing details in later pipeline steps)

    - Testing:
      - PyTest as testing framework
      - continuous integration
      - each new feature needs to be tested before merge (see below: GIT)

  - Other:
    - Data Preparation

- Future:
  - Base VISPR code on SPRINCL for (dynamic/static)

- GIT:
  - merge: rebase + fast forward merge
  - no squash
  - pull requests
  - new features are to be submitted with corresponding test cases (pytest)
