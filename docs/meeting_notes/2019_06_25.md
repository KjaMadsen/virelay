## Project Structure

- All projects in one Git repository "sprincl"
- Python modules in top-level folder
- We still have to decide on where to put native code (C code)
- Documentation in the `docs` directory
- For each meeting, record meeting notes and put them in the sub-directory `docs/meeting-notes`, the file name should be
  `yyyy-mm-dd.md`

## Coding Guidelines

- NumPy docstring style
- PEP8
- PyLint
  - --max-line-length 120
  - --disable R0902,R0913,R0914
- Imports in the order: builtin, third-party, own
- First normal imports, then from-imports
- Testing using PyTest

## Visualization App

- Bokeh as a visualization framework
- Name to be determined
- The first prototype will be put into the repository today

## Structuring SPRINCL Output

- Everything is HDF5
- vca-gpu-211-01, /data/shared/sprincl/attributions, /data/shared/sprincl/analysis
- All keys are in singular
- Attribution file: keys are `attribution` (float32), `label` (uint16), and `prediction` (float32, all logits)
- One large file per model and attribution method
- File names: `<model>-<attribution-method>.attribution.h5` (underscores for spaces)
- Meta-analysis file: `<model>-<attribution-method>-<analysis-name>.analysis.h5`
  - `<analysis-name>` is an identifier for the analysis approach, e.g. different distance metrics, graph methods etc.
- top-level keys are the name of the analysis (not necessarily only one single class!)
  - for ImageNet, the class-wise analysis is given by its word-net-id
- each analysis key will have the following sub-keys:
  - `index`: Sample indices in the input attribution file (uint32) [samples]
  - `eigenvalue`: Eigenvalues for the spectral embedding (float32) [eigenvalues]
  - `eigenvector`: Eigenvectors for the spectral embedding (float32) [samples x eigenvalues]
  - `cluster/<name>`: Label for clusters on the spectral embedding with clustering `<name>` (uint32) [samples]
    - `cluster/kmeans-<k>`: Label for clusters on the spectral embedding using k-means with k=`<k>` (uint32) [samples]
    - attributes are used to define parameters of the used algorithm
      - `eigenvector`: the indices of the used eigenvectors (uint)
      - `k`: k (number of clusters) for k-means (uint8) [samples]
  - `visualization/<name>`: Additional embedding used for visualization with name `<name>`
    - `visualization/tsne`: t-SNE Embedding (float32) [samples x 2]
    - attributes:
    - `eigenvector`: the indices of the used eigenvectors (uint32)
